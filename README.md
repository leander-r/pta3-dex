## Usage Guide

### Creating Your First Trainer

1. Open the **Trainer** tab — a default trainer is ready to edit
2. Set your trainer's name, age, and gender
3. Allocate the 25 creation stat points using point-buy (max 6 per stat at creation)
4. Add a trainer class; pick your class-granted skill talents in the skill picker
5. Level up to spend +2 level stat points per level (no per-stat cap, max 10 per stat)
6. Roll HP bonuses automatically at levels 3, 7, and 11

### Adding Pokémon to Your Team

1. Go to the **Pokémon** tab and click **Add Pokémon**
2. Search for a species by name
3. Set level, nature, and nickname — stats come directly from the Pokédex entry
4. Add up to 6 moves from the species' move pool
5. Collapse the card when done; it stays in your party

### Battle & Dice Roller

1. Go to the **Battle** tab
2. Select **Pokémon** mode to roll move damage, or **Trainer** mode for skill checks (1d20 + modifier + talent bonus)
3. Adjust combat stages with the ± buttons; each stage adds or subtracts 2 flat from the stat
4. Track HP damage directly on each Pokémon's combat row

Export actions live in the **Share & Export** section at the bottom of the sidebar:

- **Export Cards** — generate image cards for your trainer or Pokémon
- **Print Sheet** — opens a print-ready page; choose *Save as PDF* in the browser print dialog

JSON backups and the Import option are available via the **☰ menu** in the header.

### Multiple Trainers
